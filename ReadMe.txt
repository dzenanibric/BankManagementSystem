The data remains preserved even after the program is shut down, and this is because this program saves the data in txt documents that the program retrieves when it needs it.

The following things have been done:
- Creating a new member / account
- Update existing account data
- Checking account information
- List all members and save in txt document
- Transactions (deposit, withdrawal)
- Delete the desired member
- System reset

I would like to point out the management of the date that has been done, it is impossible to miss how many days there are in which month, it is known exactly which is 31 and which is 30, for February it is known which year is 28 and which year is 29 days. .

The program covers every possible user input.
